# Tuned ResNet50 + Xception Ensemble for Dog Breed Classification

A PyTorch project using a **ResNet50 and Xception ensemble** to classify dog breeds from images.  
Leveraging transfer learning with both models, the ensemble achieves high accuracy on a variety of dog breeds.

## Features
- Ensemble of ResNet50 and Xception for improved performance
- Transfer learning for both models
- High-accuracy dog breed classification
